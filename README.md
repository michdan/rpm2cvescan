## Original repo

[bigHosting/rpm2cvescan](https://github.com/bigHosting/rpm2cvescan)

## Why

This python version is a rewrite of the original Perl version, as it needed
an extra C program to use the Python rpmvercmp function. It was more logical
to have the complete tool in Python.

This tool will only report information about packages used by RedHat. If custom rpms are used,
e.g. php 7.1 or httpd 2.4 , this tool is not capabale of detecting vulnerabilities simply
because com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL7.xml has info on what's installed by default on your distro version,
e.g. php 5.3 for EL6.

## General info

As the tool needs to run on CentOS 6 and 7 systems (in my setup) it's written
and tested for python 2.7.5.

rpm2cvescan is a RedHat/CentOS 5/6/7/8 rpm cve vulnerability scanner based on
  * RedHat's OVAL info for RHEL5,6,7,8:
    * [com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL5.xml](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL5.xml)
    * [com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL6.xml](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL5.xml)
    * [com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL7.xml](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL7.xml)
    * [com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL8.xml](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL8.xml)

## How does this work

  Based on the collected rpms, the rhel major release of the system it's run on
  and the corresponding rhsa file, a data structure is created to store all
  patches with the data that is used (RHA ID, CVEs, rpms + version)

  After collecting all data, a routine will walk trough all patches and per
  patch will check if any of the rpms is installed and when it's found, if
  the version of the rpm is the same or newer then the one mentioned in the
  patch.

  When all rpms of a patch are compared with the installed rpms, a decission
  is made based on the following criteria:

  * At least 1 rpm was found on the system and it's version is lower then
    reported with the patch
    -> added to 'to_install' patch list.

  * At least 1 rpm was found on the system and it's version is equal or
    higher then reported with the patch **and** no rpms were found of
    the 1st category
    -> added to added to 'installed' patch list.

  * No rpms were found that the patch applies to
    -> added to the 'na' patch list.

## How to run the scanner
  * download RedHat all oval files to be sure you have the latest revision:
```
       # ./download.sh
```

  * run the python program:
```
       # ./rpm2cvescan.py
```

## Command line options

To limit the output of the tool, several commandline options have been
implemented to only display:

  * Installed RHAs (-i, --installed)
  * Missing or incomplete RHAs (-m, --missing)
  * Summary of results (-s, --summary)

### Installed

With this option, the tool will only display detailed output for all
RHAs correctly installed on the system.

This option can be combined with the summary option, which then will
display the summary of the installed RHAs at the bottom of the output.

### Missing

With this option, the tool will only display detailed output for all
RHAs not or incompletely installed on the system.

This option can be combined with the summary option, which then will
display the summary of the missing RHAs at the bottom of the output.

### Summary

This option just displays the summary. This option can be used for
monitoring purposes.

When combined with installed or missing, the summary of just the
specified caregory will be shown at the bottom of the detailed output
of that command.
